# Diabetes-Prediction-Analysis

# About Dataset
  This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict
whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements
included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of
these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are
females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Columns and Description for dataset
• Pregnancies
• Glucose
• Blood Pressure
• Skin Thickness
• Insulin
• BMI
• Diabetes
• Age
• Outcome

From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of
them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target
dependent variable (Outcome).

# Key Tools Used:
  Employed Python along with pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for the intricate processes of data preparation, analysis, and visualization. For model training, Logistic Regression and KNN models were implemented.

# Highlights of the Analysis: 
  Conducted a robust statistical analysis to pinpoint features correlated with diabetes, encompassing variables such as glucose levels, BMI, and age, among others.

# Key Discoveries: 
  Unearthed insights indicating that individuals over the age of 30 with elevated BMI and glucose levels are more prone to diabetes.
Crafted a user-friendly Python-based GUI to present visualizations and insights derived from the data analysis.

# Project Outcomes:
1. Successfully identified the most influential predictors for diabetes within the dataset, contributing valuable insights for medical diagnosis.
2. Enhanced proficiency in exploratory analysis and statistical modeling using Python.
3. Acquired valuable experience in data visualization and presentation, employing tools such as Ecel, Powe Query, Power BI and Jupyter Notebook.
